# SQL challenge

## EmployeeSQL

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this repo, I designd the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data. In other words, I performed:

1. Data Engineering

2. Data Modeling

3. Data Analysis


**In this repo**

In this repo you can find a directory called *EmployeeSQL* that stores inside the following:
1. Data folder - with csvs
2. PNG file - a picutre of my ERD
3. SQL file - 'schema.sql' that contains the creating of the tables and constrains 
4. SQL file- 'queries.sql' that contains answers about the data
